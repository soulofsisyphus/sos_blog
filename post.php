          Every journey begins with a single spark — mine was the realization that creativity and code could tell stories together.
          I wasn’t just building websites; I was crafting experiences that reflect emotion, rhythm, and purpose.

          When I first wrote <code>console.log("Hello World")</code>, it felt like whispering to the digital void.
          Over time, those whispers turned into videos, tutorials, and this very blog — a place where I merge my <span class="neon">passion for development</span>
          with storytelling.

        <p>
          Now, every line of code I write reminds me of that first moment of curiosity.
          I’ve learned that progress isn’t about speed, but about consistency — one project, one post, one story at a time.
